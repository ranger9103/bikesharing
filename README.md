# Bike Sharing

## Overview
Des Moines is a potential bike-sharing site that the client would like to evaluate. They would like to utilize New York City data to determine the best implementation strategy.

## Results
Trip Duration by Gender- The trend distribution is similar between all genders. 

Trip Duration – Trip duration is shown to be generally less than 1 hour. 

Trips by Weekday - Weekends show more usage throughout the day where weekdays have the highest utilization in the commuter timeframes.

Trips by Gender – The general pattern of usage is similar across genders with the commuter times during the week and midday over the weekends.

User Trips by Gender – There are many more subscriber trips utilized with males using more than females. Usage by subscribers is also higher during the weekday. 

Number of Trips by User Type – The majority of trips are by subscribers with less than ¼ of trips by a non-subscriber customer.

August Peak Hours – The evening hours are this highest overall utilization with the early morning being the least.

## Summary
With utilization being the least in the early morning hours, this would be the best time for maintenance. Although the feasibility of this would also depend on the workforce availability and willingness to work those hours. Most utilization is likely by subscribers who use the service to commute to and from work locations with a lower percentage of users being weekend casual use. 

Further visualizations that would be helpful would be an age distribution to compare demographic data of the two cities. Another would be weather analysis and comparison to determine if the data is reasonable to compare New York to Des Moines.
