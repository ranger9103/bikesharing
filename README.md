## Summary
With utilization being the least in the early morning hours, this would be the best time for maintenance. Although the feasibility of this would also depend on the workforce availability and willingness to work those hours. Most utilization is likely by subscribers who use the service to commute to and from work locations with a lower percentage of users being weekend casual use. 

Further visualizations that would be helpful would be an age distribution to compare demographic data of the two cities. Another would be weather analysis and comparison to determine if the data is reasonable to compare New York to Des Moines.
